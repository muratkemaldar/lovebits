## What is LoveBits?

LoveBits is a small experience meant to make coding languages more appealing to non-developers by writing JavaScript code poems.

üèÖLoveBits won the Hack of the Month award at [Berlin Hack and Tell #73](https://berlinhackandtell.rocks/2019-07-30-no73-libre-not-libra) in July 2019.

## Motivation

There are a lot of misconceptions about coding. People get intimitated, and don't know where to start because they don't treat it like a human language.

Main ideas are:

- Overcoming the coding language barrier by combining code with something "that you can do with human languages" (like poems) to create a different approach to coding
- Putting the message of code before the basics of coding

You can read more about it on [the article I wrote for the Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/07/writing-code-poems/).

## Contribution

This is my first open-source project.

Please create a fork and create Pull Requests for new poems, improvements, and more. If you have any questions or need feedback to create a new poem, just let me know.

**Here are some topics you can help with, if you want to**:

- New poems
- Responsiveness (This is somewhat big, because of static numbers in poems. Needs some effort.)
- Tests?

## Development

Fork and clone the project.

`npm install`

`npm start`

After you did your changes, create a Pull Request. Once the code is is merged, it will automatically be deployed via Netlify.

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/2e4a2a19-2f59-4776-9669-8c9abfbeb8d7/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/lovebits/deploys)

## Tech

- React (for the UI)
- Paper.js (for the interactive parts of each poem)
